Changes in Version 1.1.1+
-------------------------

Version 1.1.1+ fixes many installation problems and introduces
installation instructions to the REAMDE.

.. Warning:: RENAME of ``mongo_connector.py`` module to
             ``connector.py``. Thus, if you should need to import the
             ``Connector`` object, you now should do
             ``from mongo_connector.connector import Connector``
